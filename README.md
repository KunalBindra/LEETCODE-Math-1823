# LEETCODE-Math-1823
The provided `Solution` class is implementing a method to find the winner of a game using a variation of the Josephus problem. Here is the dry run for the method `findTheWinner` with an example where `n = 4` and `k = 2`.

### Code Breakdown
1. **Public Method `findTheWinner`**:
   - Takes two parameters: `n` (number of people) and `k` (the step count).
   - Calls the helper method `f(n, k)` and returns the result incremented by 1 to convert the 0-indexed result to 1-indexed.

2. **Private Method `f`**:
   - Implements the Josephus problem in a 0-indexed format.
   - Uses a loop to compute the position of the last person standing.

### Dry Run Example with `n = 4` and `k = 2`

1. **Initial Call**:
   - `findTheWinner(4, 2)`

2. **Execution of `f` Method**:
   - `ans` starts at 0 (because `f(1, k) = 0` for any `k`).
   - Loop through `i` from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Iterations**:
   - **Iteration 1** (`i = 2`):
     - `ans = (ans + k) % i = (0 + 2) % 2 = 0`
   - **Iteration 2** (`i = 3`):
     - `ans = (ans + k) % i = (0 + 2) % 3 = 2`
   - **Iteration 3** (`i = 4`):
     - `ans = (ans + k) % i = (2 + 2) % 4 = 0`

4. **Final Result**:
   - The `f` method returns 0.
   - `findTheWinner` adds 1 to convert to 1-indexed.
   - `findTheWinner(4, 2)` returns `1`.

### Conclusion
For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the winner is at position `1`.

The dry run demonstrates how the algorithm calculates the winner's position using the properties of the Josephus problem. The key idea is to keep track of the position using modulo operations to simulate the circular nature of the game.
